# Email-Classifier-Naive-Bayes-
We use the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify email as ham (good emails) or spam (bad emails)
based on their content. The Naive Bayes algorithm calculates the probability for an object for 
each possible class, and then returns the class with the highest probability. For this probability 
calculation the algorithm uses features. The reason it's called Naive Bayes is because it does not 
incorporate any correlation between features. In other words, each feature counts the same.
